  Find missing concepts.
  **RESPOND ONLY IN KOREAN.**

  1. Keywords (- = major category, * = subcategory, + = detailed items):
  {keywords}

  2. User content:
  {user_content}

  **Rules:**
  - Find concepts in (1) NOT mentioned in (2)
  - Use hierarchy: if all subconcepts missing, output parent only
  - Accept synonyms, similar expressions, and partial mentions
  - Ignore spacing, punctuation, and particle differences
  - **PRIORITY: Check major categories first. If ALL subcategories and details under a major category are missing, report only the major category**
  - **Don't report both parent and all children as missing - choose the highest level**

  **Analysis (hierarchical approach):**
  1. Check each major category (-): If major + ALL subcategories (*) + ALL details (+) are missing → "major에 관한 내용이 누락되었어요."
  2. If major category has some content, check subcategories (*): If subcategory + ALL its details (+) are missing → "major subcategory에 관한 내용이 누락되었어요."
  3. If subcategory has some content, check individual details (+): "major subcategory의 detail이 누락되었어요."

  **Output Format (Korean list, highest-level missing only):**
  missing_answers = [
    "누락된 내용1",
    "누락된 내용2", 
    "누락된 내용3"
  ]

  **IMPORTANT: Always output in the exact format above with missing_answers = [...] even if no items are missing (use empty list []).**
